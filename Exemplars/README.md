# Specifying Implementations

version 0.3.2, 2025-12-29 

*this is work-in-progress material*

[§3]:  see section 3 of the Interim Report[^1]


## Purpose

A conforming implementation supports one or more formats [§3,3.1]. While the standard specifies a uniform set of operations, predicates, functions, and block operations, there are ways that one implementation may differ from another.  The independent specifics of an implmentation are provided to users in a uniform, formalized way.  The formalism is designed to be clear, well-structured, flexible, expressive, and consistent.
